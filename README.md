# Remotion video

A poor-man version of TI10 team intro video made using Remotion. Made for fun and practice. Code is messy. Please do not expect it to be tidied ðŸ˜›

See example video in [./samples/video.mp4](./samples/video.mp4)
Note that the example was not actually rendered using Remotion because it was too slow. I played the video preview and did a screen record using OBS as an alternative.
